            id (str): Unique identifier of the 'Sample' object. Defaults to 'None'.
            name (): Plain-text name of this item..
            sample_id (): None.
            id (): Anchor point for digital signature. This identifier is referred to from the 'Reference' element in a Signature. Unique per document.. Defaults to None
            barcode (): Value of barcode label that is attached to sample container.. Defaults to None
            comment (): Unstructured text comment to further describe the Sample.. Defaults to None
            derived (): Indicates whether this is a derived Sample. A derived Sample is a Sample that has been created by applying a Technique. (Sub-Sampling, Processing, ...). Defaults to None
            container_type (): Whether this sample is also a container for other samples. Set to 'simple' if not.. Defaults to None
            container_id (): Sample ID of container in which this sample is located.. Defaults to None
            location_in_container (): Coordinates of this sample within the enclosing container. In case of microplates or trays, the row is identified by letters and the column is identified by numbers (1-based) while in landscape orientation. Examples: A10 = 1st row, 10th column, Z1 = 26th row, 1st column, AB2 = 28th row, 2nd column.. Defaults to None

            tag_set (): Set of Tag elements.. Defaults to None
            category (): Defines a category of Parameters and SeriesSets. Used to model hierarchies.. Defaults to ListPlus()
